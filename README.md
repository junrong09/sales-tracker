# DFS Sales Tracker
## Overview
### Problem Statement
At present, Sales Associates (SA), serving in our DFS store-front, track their personal sales using a handwritten
 notepad. This is often inaccurate as SAs tend to miss out on the opportunity to record down their sales during heavy
  customer inflow.
 
 Secondly, the daily sales targets, allocated by store managers, were not tracked. As such, it is impossible to
  analyse the progress of their actual sales against their sales target.

This application serves to help SAs track their sales real-time and measure their performance
 against to their target. The application also provide analytical capabilities which will drive the SA to be more goal
 -oriented
